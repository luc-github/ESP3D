# Wiring ESP32 CAM
Once the board is programmed, the wiring to the printer board should be like this:

note: this is not the only way to connect the board.
* other values for the resistors could be used (always in the ratio 1:2)
* could use a logic level coverter 5V - 3.3V (see [D1-mini wiki page](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D/wiki/D1-mini) )
