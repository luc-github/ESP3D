ESP need 3.3v, it is not 5v tolerant, if printer board use more than 3.3V like 5V on ramps.

In order to flash some ESP12E/F boards via their UART interface, the following pins need to be connected:

* VCC to GPIO2
* GND to GPIO0

This has been tested with ESP-12-E boards labeled "ESP8266 For ESP3D FYSETC.COM"
