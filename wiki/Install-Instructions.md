## Building with PlatformIO and VScode (recommended method)

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download [latest release](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D/releases/latest) of this project
    - Extract it anywhere
3. Open the forlder containing the project from within VScode (file->open folder)
4. Let VScode install exptension packages recommended by the project. 
    - A popup should appear in lower right corner
    - It will install extensions listed in .vscode/extensions.json
    - Wait for complete installation
5. Build with PlatformIO
    - Click to open the platformIO tab on the left  (or ctrl+maj+P and type `View: Show PlatformIO`)
    - Unwrap target corresponding to your board
    - Click on `Upload` to build and upload FW to ESP board

## Building with Arduino IDE

### Video guide by Chris Riley

### Written guide

1. Arduino IDE
    - Download Arduino IDE version 1.x.y from <https://www.arduino.cc/en/Software>
    - Install the Arduino IDE
2. Additional libraries
    - Open the Arduino IDE go to File -> Preferences
    - In the "Additional Boards Manager URL" field, paste: <http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json>
    - Click OK
    - Click Tools -> Boards -> Board Manager
    - Scroll to near the bottom, and find "esp8266 by ESP8266 Community" and click on the row
    - On the "Select Version" dropdown, select version according to [ESP3D home page](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D)
    - Wait for the ESP8266 support to be installed
3. Download [latest release](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D/releases/latest) of this project
    - Extract it to your sketchbook or other location
    - Copy the libraries present in the ESP3D-x.y.z/libraries directory into your Arduino/libraries directory. These versions are verified to work with ESP3D, any others (newer version) may cause untested behavior. More information about libraries installation options [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries)
    - Open the Arduino IDE and open the project file esp3d/esp3d.ino (ESP8266/esp8266.ino for older versions)
4. Configure for your board
    - [Get flash sise of your board](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP8266/wiki/Flash-Size#figuring-out-the-flash-size)
    - Apply [correct setting](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP8266/wiki/Flash-Size) in Arduinio -> tools ->board
    - Double check you have the clock speed set to 160Mhz
    - Double check you have the correct Flash size selected
5. Upload the sketch
    - Configure your ESP8266 or ESP32 for upload (USB to serial plugged in, GPIO0 and GPIO15 pulled low, RST pulled high)
    - Click the Upload button in Arduino IDE (Or press Ctrl+U)

Follow additional steps [here](#Common-steps-for-all-methods)

## Common steps for all methods

6. Starting the board
    - Reboot the ESP8266 or ESP32 into run mode (USB to serial removed , GPIO0 pulled high,  GPIO15 pulled low, RST pulled high)
    - Find the wifi AP (Access Point) called **ESP3D** (or ESP8266 in older versions)
    - Connect to the wifi AP using the default password of **12345678**
7. Initial configuration
    - Open device web page on the AP connected device with one of 2 following options:
        - Accept Captive portal redirect
        - Open a web browser and navigate to <http://192.168.0.1>
    - Upload index.html.gz file to the SPIFFS filesystem using web page uploader
8. Configure device
    - If authentication is enabled use pair user/password **admin**/**admin**
    - I recommend changing to Station mode and connecting to your home/office Wifi instead of staying in AP mode
    - You may want to change the Baud rate
    - You can change to DHCP, or at the very least setup a Static IP you are familiar with
9. Connect ESP board to your printer motherboard
    - More details can be found [here](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP3D/wiki/Hardware-connection)

## Additional tips

- If you plan to access your ESP from public network, think about [cybersecurity](https://github.com/luc-github/ESP8266/wiki/Cybersecurity-concerns)

- You can use Arduino serial monitor or PlatformIO `Monitor` target to see debug info from ESP and send commends for configuration. Commands are documented in wiki/docs folder

- After applying power the ESP takes approx 10 seconds before it will send `M117 <ip address>` on the serial port. If your printer is connected to the ESP, and has an LCD connected, the M117 command is "Print this message to the LCD" - i.e after a successful boot it will print the IP address to the printer's LCD

- If you mess up a configuration you can pull down GPIO2 during reset/powerup to wipe the settings stored in EEPROM.

- If behavior is not consistent, you may need to erase the full flash on ESP board.

## Full ESP erase

There are several options to erase flash configuration:

- Execute `[ESP444]RESET` after upload and restart the board
- In Arduino IDE, you can configure erase method in tools->Erase Flash->All Flash content. This will erase whole memory at next upload.
- Using PlatformIO if there is a target Patform->Erase Flash for your board
- Using [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) with command `esptool.exe --chip auto erase_flash`
